# Robot2015
This is the robot program code for St. Mary's of Lynn's FRC team Spartans. The code instructs the robot to play Recycle Rush, the 2015 FRC season's game.

Written in Java using the WPIlib robot code library plugin for the eclipse IDE and the TI robo-rio controller board.

Meant to be deployed by the drivers station set of tools, generally installed before installing the wpilib plugin.

The code is simple, much of it was re-serviced with permission from team 1761 Steam Punk Tigers's 2014 code, which I helped write during my tenure on that team. As such, it contains a huge number of comments and auto generated code from RobotBuilder, which I will clean up soon.
